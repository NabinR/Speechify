                        Our philosophy is based on learning while having fun and connecting with others.
                        At Speechify we work with a person’s interests and strengths in order to help them do the best
                        they can. We believe that it is very important for us to make the process of learning as fun and
                        easy to absorb as possible. Nothing motivates learners as much as fun does because it comes from
                        genuine interest from within instead of pressure from others. Students are much more likely to
                        invest extra time in the learning process if they enjoy it.

                        Together we aim to:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="text-muted text-left">
                        <li>Use a family-centered approach. We recognise that families are the experts on their child
                            and work with in partnership with you to help your child reach their goals.</li>
                        <li>Give you the resources and knowledge so that you can help your child build skills and become
                            more independent. We don’t want you to be coming to therapy forever! We aim to give you the
                            tools so that you know exactly what to do, where to go for support, what you can be doing at
                            home, school or out in the community. </li>
                        <li>Develop communication for those clients who are non-verbal or have limited verbal language.
                            We believe in augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) and the doors it can unlock
                            for those clients who are non-verbal or unintelligible in their speech.</li>
                        <li>Look at the whole picture. “Kids do well if they can” (Ross Greene, Clinical Psychologist).
                            We aim to help children build on skills they are lacking in order to reduce the challenging
                            behaviours they are experiences at home, school and in the community.</li>
                        <li>Support school-leavers in transitioning into life after school. We work closely with
                            job-support. Therapy is provided so that clients can cope with the social, emotional and
                            communication demands of paid employment.</li>
                        <li>Help children interact with their peers through play. We can offer therapy during recess and
                            lunch times at school.</li>
                        <li>Provide evidence based therapy using the latest tools and resources.</li>
                        <li>Our therapists can speak Hindi, Urdu, Nepalese and Cantonese. We have an understanding of
                            bilingualism and language development. Therapy can be conducted in languages mentioned
                            above. </li>
                        <li>When working with children with complex needs, we adopt a transdisciplinary approach at
                            Speechify. We work closely with occupational therapists, psychologists, teachers, tutors,
                            music therapists etc. to gain a complete picture of a child. Collaborative information
                            sharing across disciplines helps us to set functional goals that can be generalised across
                            people, activities and settings.</li>

                            For example, learning to use the internet, send text messages and emails, learning to use a
                            diary and reminders to help plan and organise day.</li>

                        <li>Our goal in therapy is for our clients to become as independent as possible, reach their
                            full potential, do what they enjoy as well as have some fun along the way.</li>
                        <li>We work with highly reputable psychologists, occupational therapists, music and art
                            therapists. In instances where this might be of benefit, we can invite them in for joint
